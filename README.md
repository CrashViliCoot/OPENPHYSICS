#OPENPHYSICS
A lightweight, easy-to-use 2D physics engine written in C#, designed for game developers who want a free and simple alternative to heavy physics middleware like Havok.

This project includes:

Core 2D physics engine with rigid bodies, collisions, and gravity

Simple API to integrate into any C# game framework or custom engine

Examples folder with a minimal console based 3D engine demo featuring cubes and spheres

Clean, modular codebase to extend with 3D physics, rendering, and input handling

Features:
RigidBody dynamics with mass, position, velocity, and static bodies support

Axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection.

Easy to embed in any C# project.

Basic 3D math and entity system demo in the /Examples folder.

Getting Started:
dotnet run
Run the main 2D physics demo. To try the 3D example:

cd Examples
dotnet run Demo3DProgram.cs

Why use this?
If you want to build games from scratch or learn how physics engines work without complicated setups, this project is a great starting point. Itâ€™s open source and easy to modify.
